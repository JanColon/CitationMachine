# CitationMachine
I made a citation machine in python. It isn't exactly a citation machine, it just formats the input in MLA format. Enjoy!

# Features
- Create citations in MLA format
- Can add annotations to your citations
- Able to add citations into a text document

# Bugs, limitations, etc.
- Can't backtrack to previous parameters if a user error is made
- Can't give the bibliography text file a unique name
- Citations don't have text wrapping
- Citations don't include hanging indents for wrapped text (goes against MLA format)
- Can't make citations in increments (script needs to be restarted to add more citations)
